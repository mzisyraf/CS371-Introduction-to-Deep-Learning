# CS371-Introduction-to-Deep-Learning
This repo houses all the assignments I got a chance to do for my Deep Learning course at KAIST. Below is the summary of what is achieved for each assignment.

### HW1_Intro to Deep Learning
* Implement forward computation for Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) neural network.
* Implement a backpropagation algorithm to compute gradients for the network.
* Implement a Gradient Descent optimization algorithm to train the network.
* Train and test the network on a synthetic dataset for binary classification.

### HW2_Image Classification using CNN
* Implement a Convolutional Block
* Implement a Residual Block
* Implement a Residual Block with a bottleneck
* Implement an Inception Block
* Implement a network to implement the created blocks to classify images

### HW3_Image Segmentation using FCN
* Perform semantic segmentation on the PASCAL VOC 2011 dataset which contains 20 object categories

### HW4_Neural Machine Translation
* Perform neural machine translation with recurrent neural networks and attention based models on Multi30k dataset which include language pairs of German and English
* Implement LSTM , LSTM with Attention and Transformer with Masked Multihead Attention
